# `constructor-super`

Constructors of derived classes must call `super()`.
Constructors of non derived classes must not call `super()`.
If this is not observed, the JavaScript engine will raise a runtime error.

This rule is aimed to flag invalid/missing `super()` calls.

The config that applied to this rule are:

```js
{
  'constructor-super': 'error',
}
```

## Invalid

```js invalid
class A {
  constructor() {
    super(); // This is a SyntaxError.
  }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() { } // Would throw a ReferenceError.
}

// Classes which inherits from a non constructor are always problems.
class A extends null {
  constructor() {
    super(); // Would throw a TypeError.
  }
}

class A extends null {
  constructor() { } // Would throw a ReferenceError.
}
```

## Valid

```js valid
class A {
  constructor() { }
}

class A extends B {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}
```
